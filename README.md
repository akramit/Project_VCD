# VC-Dimension
Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension (VC-dimension) is a combinatorial measure of a set system of subsets of a universe, developed by Vapnik and Chervonenkis during 1960- 1990 and has found deep applications in the area of statistical learning theory, discrete and computational geometry. Let U be universe and F be a set of subsets of U. The family F is said to shatter a subset S ⊆ U if for all subset S′ ⊆S,there is an F ∈F such that S∩F =S′. VC-dimension is the size of the largest set shattered by the family.
